# Oblivion-autoclicker
Simple autoclicker for both Left and Right mouse buttons.

Made by @ekk_ivox.

Oblivion V2 was made using visual studio and C#. Took me about 2.5 hours to make this.
Main usage which i intended this to be for, is minecraft pvp. But you can use it for any other purposes.

Make sure to install .NET Runtime version 6 if any errors show upon runing the exe file.
